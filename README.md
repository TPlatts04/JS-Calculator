2. Download these files and drag them into a new folder which you will need to open in the IDE.
3. ***If you don't want to download all files and only the JS File then follow steps 4-6***
4. Make sure you have Node.JS installed onto your device, if not here is a link to the download: ***https://nodejs.org/en/download***
5. In your terminal ensure to type: npm init ***This will initialise the Node.JS files** **NOTE: If node is not recognised then restart IDE or device and then it will work***
6. After initalisation, in your terminal type the following: npm i prompt-sync ***This will then download the module files***
7. After everything is ready to go, in your terminal, type the following to run the program: node calculator.js
